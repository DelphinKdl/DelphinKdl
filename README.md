<h4> What I’m working on: </h4>
  - <b>Developing user-friendly interfaces</b> with Streamlit and FastAPI to make predictive models more accessible.
  
  - <b>Documenting each project  for smooth deployment and long-term usability using Docker, Git, and CI/CD pipelines.
    
  - <b> Creating educational content</b> to help others apply data science in practical ways, soon to be shared on LinkedIn and Medium.

I’m pursuing my MSc in Data Analytics at The Catholic University of America, with a solid background in IT consulting, data wrangling (Pandas, SQL), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, and Power BI), and machine learning (Scikit-learn). My career goal is to work as a **Data Scientist**, building tools that empower analysts, scientists, developers, and decision-makers alike.
